# bikes-or-no-bikes
My second project done during my Data Analytics course with General Assembly where I used SQL for querying
before constructing visualisations and conducting analysis using Excel. 

In this project I explored whether there was a need to add more bikes / docks during the peak hours for Santander 
Cycles, a public bike hire scheme in the UK. I have also included the final deck presented together with the script
file with the syntaxes used for querying in SQL for reference.
